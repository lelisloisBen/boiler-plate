# React Hooks Easy Start

## I created a boiler plate, with this you can start working on a small to medium Single Page Application

### run this commands to start
```
npm install
npm start
```


In this example, you can go to Demo view and fill up the form, the informations will be store as state in the App.js 

Once you clicked submit, you will be send to home page.

The states are available in all the views.

The image is imported in the app.js and we can access everywhere, any views of the project.

I add a page called Fetch where I fetch from futurama's API.

all the data from this API is accessible in all the project too.

If you have any questions feel free to reach.

Have fun.
